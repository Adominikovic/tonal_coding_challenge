## Project Architecture Info

Hello Reviewer,

First, I had lots of fun working on this! 
Here is a little information about the project structure that I hope will make the process behind 
some of my decisions a bit more clear.

I use a simple bloc architecture for this metrics app. I have all of my logic which handles app state
in the project's logic directory and all of the demo page ui and widgets in the presentation directory.
I used the provided styles file to style the metrics widget as close to the design images as possible 
and I also commented the code where I felt it would be helpful.

I also left the unit tests for the metrics cubit in the test directory.

Thank you so much for the opportunity!

Kind Regards,
Antonio Dominikovic
